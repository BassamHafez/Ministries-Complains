# Ministries-Complains
Welcome to the Ministries-Complains in Kuwait GitHub repository!
Our frontend solution, developed based on specific customer requests, provides a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and complaints about ministries in Kuwait. Made with HTML, pure CSS, and JavaScript, the website features essential pages such as Home, Login, Register, About, Complains, and Profile.
This customer-driven platform aims to streamline the process of submitting complaints and facilitate effective communication with the dedicated Kuwait complains teams. By addressing citizens' concerns, we strive to promote transparency and accountability in Kuwait.
We appreciate your interest in the Ministries-Complains in Kuwait project. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements as we work together to empower citizens and bring about positive change.
